## Credit Risk Classification Report

## Overview of the Analysis

* Purpose of the analysis was to develop a machine learning model that accuractly predicts credit risk.

* The project's goal was to predict the loan status where 0 shows a healthy loan and 1 shows a high risk loan. 

## Results

* Precison:
    * Healthy loans ("0") - 100% of loans predicted as healthy loans were healthy.
    * High Risk loans ("1") - 85% of loans predicted as high risk loans were high risk.

* F1-Score:
    * Healthy loans had a perfect 1.0 F1-score, meaning the model is extremely accurate at predicting healthy loans.
    * High Risk loans had a .88 F1-score, meaning the model is fairly good at predicting high risk loans.

## Summary

The model is very accurate at predicting healthy loans but less so for high risk loans.
